# 0x0B-ssh

## Background Context

Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using `ssh`. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. Weâ€™ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of [a previous project](https://intranet.alxswe.com/tasks/1223) shared in your intranet profile.

You can access your server information in the `my servers` section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via `ssh`.

Note: Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
